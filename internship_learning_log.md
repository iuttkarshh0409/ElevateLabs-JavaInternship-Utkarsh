# üìò ElevateLabs Java Internship: Learning Log

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Log

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Java Fundamentals
**Date:** [23/04/2025]  
**Task:** Build a basic Java program (e.g., calculator/string manipulations)  
**Concepts Practiced:**
- Java syntax and structure
- Data types, variables
- Loops and conditional statements
- Functions and method calls

**Key Learnings:**
- Refreshed Java basics with `if-else`, `switch`, and `for`/`while` loops
- Understood static methods and function calling inside `main()`

**Challenges:**
- Initially struggled with understanding parameter passing
- Took time to align logic in a clean and readable format

**Outcome:**
- Created a working CLI-based calculator/string tool
- Gained confidence in Java syntax and control flow

### ‚úÖ Day 2: Java Strings & Loops
**Date:** [24/06/2025]  
**Task:** String palindrome, reverse, character count

**Concepts Practiced:**
- Java `String` and `StringBuilder` classes
- `.equals()`, `.charAt()`, `.length()` methods
- For loops and enhanced `for-each`

**Key Learnings:**
- Difference between `==` and `.equals()` for string comparison
- Efficient string reversal using `StringBuilder`
- Explored input validation and edge case handling

**Challenges:**
- Managed character-indexing bugs during loop

**Outcome:**
- Developed robust string logic functions
- Built confidence in string manipulation techniques

### ‚úÖ Day 3: OOP & Library Management System
**Date:** [26/06/2025]  
**Task:** Build a Library Management System using Java OOP

**Concepts Practiced:**
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation, method overriding
- ArrayLists and basic CRUD operations

**Key Learnings:**
- Clean object-oriented design via `Book`, `User`, and `Library` classes
- Validated inputs (duplicate ISBN/user ID)
- Mastered array-based operations (add, update, view)

**Challenges:**
- Managing `Scanner` input mixing (`nextLine()` issues)
- Designing `issueBook()` and `returnBook()` logic cleanly

**Outcome:**
- Created a fully functional library system
- Emphasized clarity, feedback messages, and edge case coverage

---

### ‚úÖ Day 4: File I/O ‚Äì Notes Management App
**Date:** [27/06/2025]  
**Task:** CLI Notes App using `FileReader`/`FileWriter`

**Concepts Practiced:**
- File handling in Java
- `try-with-resources`
- Reading/writing lists with `Files.readAllLines` & `Files.write`
- Exception handling

**Key Learnings:**
- Implemented persistent note storage with append/overwrite modes
- Understood how to use `FileWriter` safely with auto-close
- Managed updates and deletions from text files

**Challenges:**
- Handling `Scanner` nextLine bugs across loops
- Designing an interactive CLI for consistent UX

**Outcome:**
- Finalized a working CRUD Notes App
- Achieved full understanding of basic Java file operations

---

## üìÖ Weekly Reflection (Week 1)

**Overall Progress:**
- Gained strong grasp over Java basics, OOP, and file handling
- Transitioned smoothly from core Java to intermediate CLI applications
- Practiced clean code structure, exception handling, and user interaction

**New Tools/Concepts Explored:**
- Java File I/O (`FileWriter`, `Files` API)
- Encapsulation in class design
- Edge case validation

**What Went Well:**
- Each task reinforced a core concept with practical use
- GitHub repo is clean and well-structured per-day

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Avoid `Scanner` closing inside methods (causes input loss)
- Aim to modularize logic early (separate UI from logic classes)

**Next Week Goals:**
- Prepare for data structures or advanced file/database storage
- Try using OOP + file I/O together 
- Revise common interview questions per concept
