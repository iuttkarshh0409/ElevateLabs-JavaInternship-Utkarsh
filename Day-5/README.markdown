# üè¶ Bank Management System

A command-line based **Bank Management System** built in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming principles**. This application simulates banking operations, allowing users to manage a savings account with features like deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history tracking. Developed as part of the **Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship** to practice OOP concepts and input validation.

## üíª Features

- ‚úÖ **Account Creation**: Initialize a savings account with account holder name, initial balance (minimum INR 5000), and IFSC code.
- ‚úÖ **Deposit**: Add funds to the account with validation for positive amounts.
- ‚úÖ **Withdraw**: Withdraw funds, ensuring sufficient balance and maintaining a minimum balance of INR 5000 for savings accounts.
- ‚úÖ **View Balance**: Check the current account balance.
- ‚úÖ **Account Details**: Display account holder name, balance, IFSC code, and account type.
- ‚úÖ **Transaction History**: Track and display all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks).
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Menu**: Menu-driven interface with input validation and continue/exit options.
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Exit**: Terminates with a thank-you message.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Java 17
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Interface**: Terminal (Command Line Interface)
- **Key Libraries**: `java.util.Scanner`, `java.util.ArrayList`
- **Exception Handling**: `NumberFormatException` for invalid numeric inputs

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
BankManagementSystem
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BankApp.java  # Main Java application with Account and SavingsAccount classes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Project documentation
```

### üìå Classes
- **Account**: Base class managing account details, balance, and transaction history.
- **SavingsAccount**: Extends `Account`, enforcing a minimum balance of INR 5000 for withdrawals.
- **BankApp**: Main class with the console interface and application logic.

---

## üîç How It Works

- **Account Creation**: Prompts for account holder name, initial balance (‚â• INR 5000), and IFSC code with input validation.
- **Deposit**: Adds a positive amount to the balance and logs the transaction.
- **Withdraw**: Allows withdrawals if the resulting balance meets the minimum requirement (INR 5000) and logs the transaction.
- **View Balance**: Displays the current balance and logs the check.
- **Account Details**: Shows account holder name, balance, IFSC code, and account type.
- **Transaction History**: Lists all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, balance checks).
- **Menu Interaction**: Provides a numbered menu (1‚Äì6) with robust input validation and a continue prompt (Y/N).

## üìé Concepts Practiced

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Inheritance (`SavingsAccount` extends `Account`), encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Input Handling**: `Scanner` for user input with validation for strings and numbers.
- **Data Structures**: `ArrayList` for storing transaction history.
- **Exception Handling**: `NumberFormatException` for invalid numeric inputs.
- **Defensive Programming**: Validation for empty inputs, negative amounts, and insufficient balance.

## üîê Edge Case Handling

| Case                              | Behavior                                              |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty account holder name         | Rejected with prompt to retry                         |
| Initial balance < INR 5000        | Rejected with error message                           |
| Empty IFSC code                   | Rejected with prompt to retry                         |
| Negative or zero deposit/withdrawal| Rejected with error message                           |
| Withdrawal below minimum balance   | Rejected with minimum balance warning                 |
| Non-numeric input for amounts      | Handled with `NumberFormatException`                  |
| Invalid menu option (not 1‚Äì6)     | Rejected with error message                           |
| Empty menu input                  | Rejected with prompt to enter a valid number          |
