## 🧠 Key Learnings (Updated)

- **Core Java & API Proficiency**

->Applied fundamental control structures (loops, conditionals) for algorithmic logic.

->Utilized the Java Collection Framework (List, Map, Set) for in-memory data management and manipulation.

->Leveraged the Java Streams API for declarative, functional-style data processing, such as filtering and sorting collections.

->Mastered File I/O operations using modern java.nio classes (Files, Paths) and classic java.io (BufferedReader) for reading, writing, and logging.


- **Object-Oriented Design & Principles**

->Implemented core OOP concepts including Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to create a logical and hierarchical domain model (Book, Author).

->Designed a modular, layered architecture (e.g., Controller-Service-Repository) to enforce separation of concerns, making the code easier to test and maintain.


- **Robust Error & Exception Handling**

->Implemented granular error handling using try-catch-finally blocks for predictable code execution.

->Designed and threw custom exceptions (e.g., ResourceNotFoundException) to provide meaningful, context-specific error details to API consumers.

->Managed checked exceptions like IOException during file operations to ensure application stability.


- **Professional Development & Version Control**

->Utilized Git for comprehensive version control, adopting a feature-branching workflow to manage development cycles.

->Mastered essential Git commands for staging, committing, pushing, and resolving merge conflicts when integrating code from different branches.


- **Software Quality & Maintainability**

->Wrote clean, readable, and self-documenting code following standard Java conventions.

->Applied the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to reduce redundancy and improve reusability.

-?Practiced refactoring to improve the internal structure of existing code without changing its external behavior.


- **API Design & User Interaction**

->Designed and implemented intuitive Command-Line Interface (CLI) menus for a seamless user experience.

->Developed a foundational understanding of how backend logic is exposed to a user-facing component, even in a console environment.


- **Comprehensive Documentation**

->Authored detailed README.md files with setup instructions, feature lists, and usage examples.

->Maintained structured developer logs to track progress, document challenges, and reflect on solutions, fostering a practice of continuous improvement.
