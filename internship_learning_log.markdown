- UI event handling

**Key Learnings:**
- GUI design using component-based layout
- Handling user events cleanly via lambda expressions
- Improved app responsiveness and component styling

**Challenges:**
- Managing layout alignment and resizing
- Preventing duplicate/blank entries

**Outcome:**

## üìÖ Weekly Reflection (Week 1: 23/06/2025‚Äì29/06/2025)

**Overall Progress:**
- Gained strong grasp over Java basics, OOP, and file handling
- Transitioned smoothly from core Java to intermediate CLI applications
- Practiced clean code structure, exception handling, and user interaction
